The problem statement, future work etc has been provided in the Recommender System.pptx file. The Jupyter notebook has all the necessary comments regarding the flow of code.

Few points to Note: 
1. This juper notebook was created with Windows 10 OS. You may have to change the settings for configuring Pyspark with Jupyter notebook. I have followed the one mentione here. https://medium.com/@naomi.fridman/install-pyspark-to-run-on-jupyter-notebook-on-windows-4ec2009de21f
2. Spark requires atleast 8GB of RAM - larger the better. 
3. Change the path to your data file in the notebook.
4. Please note that the data has been generated using the Faker library in Python, it is far from the real world data.
